<h2 id="typ">Vessel types, groups and classifying feature frequencies.</h3>
<p>Also known as wares, industries or technologies, i.e. a group of vessels proposed to be made by the same cultural group. As with cultural groups
  chronological and spatial boundaries of vessel types can be poorly defined. Vessel types are grouped into one or more (<mark id="gro">vessel type groups</mark>). 
For example the vessel type 'Futuna Polynesian Plainware jars' is part of the Futuna Polynesian Plainware vessel group, which is part of the Polynesian Plainware group.</p>  

<p>A vessel type describes pots with similar features, but often there is some variability in the frequency of use of these features. For example vessels of a particular type may commonly have outcurving rims, but
  occasionally have direct rims. This database uses three categories to describe the frequency of features:
 <mark id="com">commonly</mark>, <mark id="occ">occasionally</mark> and <mark id="non">none reported </mark>. <mark>Common</mark> refers to features reported or observable
in several vessels or sherds, or where numbers are available greater than 10 percent. <mark>Occasionally</mark> refers to features with only single vessel examples, or 
present but in less than 10 percent in larger samples.
<h2 id="part">Vessel parts</h2>
<h3 id="lip">Lip</h3>
<p>The edge or margin of the vessel's opening (mouth) and typically part of the <a href="#rim">rim</a>. The lip can be <a href="#declip"> decorated </a> or remain plain. 
  Vessels with two or three openings are known as <mark id="mulm">multi-mouthed</mark>.

<figcaption> Example of a spout in a Pacific jugs.</figcaption> {% endcomment %}
<h3 id="rim">Rim</h3>
<p>The section of a vessel between the uppermost change of orientation of the vessel wall and the mouth. As <a href="#dir">direct rims</a> have no change, the area is less clearly defined and typically refers to the upper area of the vessel. </p>
<h3 id="neck">Neck</h3>
<p>An area of restriction, from the rim to where the vessel wall changes direction or a corner point (generally the shoulder).
  Here this area is a 'neck' if it is an area of restriction and a <a href="#coll">'collar'</a> if it does not constrict the vessel opening. 
</p>
<h3 id="coll">Collar</h3>
<p>A region that does not restrict the vessel opening, from the rim to a lower corner point or vessel wall change of direction.

<h3 id="lamp">Lamp</h3>
<p>A vessel used as a source of light, usually by holding oil or another combustible substance such as beeswax.</p>
<h2 id="build">Vessel construction</h2>
<h3 id="temp">Manual tempering</h3>
<p>The vessel has 'manual tempering' if the potters added non-plastic inclusions, such as sand, rocks, or crushed pottery, to the ceramic paste. </p>
<h3 id="conb">Base construction</h3>
<h4 id="spib">Spiral base</h4>
<p>A base made with a clay spiral.</p>
<h4 id="ballb">Ball base</h4>
<p>A base started with a ball or lump of clay.</p>
<h4 id="slabb">Slab base</h4>
<p>A base started with a beaten slab of clay.</p>
<h3 id="conp">Primary and rim construction</h3>
<p>Vessels can be built up (or 'roughed out') using coils or slab, moulded or 'hammered' clay pieces. Alternatively, a single piece of clay can be shaped into a vessel using techniques such as pinching, moulding, 'hammering' or a wheel.
  The force to shape the clay may be applied through pressure or percussion. In some casees, a different building technique was used for the vessel rim.</p>
<h4 id="coil">Coil</h4>
<p>Coiling is a pressure technique. In coiling, the vesssel is built up using clay rolled into cylinderical coils. These coils can be added continuously in a sprial or as individual rings (with one coil per level).
  The coils can be joined into the layers below as they are added or joined afterwards. Coils can be joined to each other by pinching, spreading or drawing.</p>
<h4 id="spiral">Coil spiral</h4>
<p>A vessel-building variant of <a href='#coil'> coiling </a> where the vessel is built up by coils that may continue on, (spiral up) for more than one level. </p>
<h4 id="ring">Coil ring</h4>
<p>A vessel-building variant of <a href='#coil'> coiling </a> where the vessel is built up with every level having a complete circle coil. </p>
<h4 id="slab">Slab</h4>
<p>Slab building is a vessel-forming percussion technique, in which the vessel is built up with pre-made slabs of clay. The slabs are created by being sliced off, or feet, hands or a tool are used to flatten the clay into round or rectangular slabs. </p>
<h4 id="pinch">Pinching</h4>
<p>Pinching is a pressure modelling technique in which the potter forms a depression in the centre of the clay and gradually shpes the vessel by pinching and drawing the walls up around the depression.</p>
<h4 id="mold">Moulding</h4>
<p>Moulding is a percussion modelling technique in which a lump or slab of clay that is pressed against, or into, a mould to shape it. 
 This technique can be used to form an entire vessel or to create individual parts that are then combined.</p> 
<h4 id="ham">Hammering</h4>
<p>Hammering is a percussion modelling technique that involves the use of fists or a tool to hollow and spread out the clay. It can be applied to a lump or a slab of clay .
  This technique can be used to form an entire vessel or to create individual parts that are then combined. For example, in modern-day Sigatoka Fiji, vessels are formed by joining two fist-hammered, slab-started pieces.</p> 
<h4 id="wheel">Wheel</h4>
<p>A technique where a vessel is shaped on a rotating wheel using hand or machine power. </p>  
<h3 id="cons">Secondary construction</h3>
<p>After the initial forming of the vessel, additional shaping of wet or leather-hard clay, aka 'pre-forming' can be done in various ways. Scraping (on wet clay) or shaving (on drier clay) is often used to refine the shape. Some vessels are beaten with a piece of wood (sometimes a paddle) or bamboo, sometimes with the use of an anvil.</p>
<h4 id="nosec">Scraping or shaving</h4>
<p>Dragging a tool across wet clay (scraping) or leather-hard clay (shaving) is a pressure <a href="cons"> pre-forming </a> technique.</p>
<h4 id="beat">Beating</h4>
<p>Beating of the outside of the vessel with a wooden or bamboo tool, is a percussion pre-forming technique.</p>
<h4 id= "pad">Paddle and anvil</h4>
<p>Beating of the outside of the vessel with a wooden paddle and the use of a stone anvil held inside the vessel. Like beating, the use of a paddle and anvil is a percussion pre-forming technique.</p>
<h2 id="rimorph">Rim morphology</h2>
<h3 id="rimdir">Rim direction</h3>
<p>The rim direction classifies the angle or orientation of the vessel's <a href="rim"> rim </a> relative to the body.</p>
<h4 id="out">Outcurving rim</h4>
<p>A rim with a concave profile, where the rim curves outward away from the vessel's centre. It features a curve as opposed to a sharp corner.</p>
<h4 id="ev">Everted rim</h4>
<p>A rim that starts from an distinct corner point in the vessel interior and angles upwards and outwards.</p>
<figure><img src="{% static "vessels/images/everted.jpg" %}" alt="Everted rims." height= 500></figure><figcaption>Everted rim examples. </figcaption> 
<h4 id="dout">Direct out rim</h4>
<p>A rim that follows the same outward trajectory as the vessel wall, without a noticeable change in direction.</p>
<h4 id="dir">Direct rim</h4>
<p>A rim that follows the vertical trajectory of the vessel wall, without a noticeable change in direction.</p>
<h4 id="din">Direct in rim</h4>
<p>A rim that follows the same inward trajectory as the vessel wall, without a noticeable change in direction.</p>
<h4 id="inv">Inverted rim</h4>
<p>A rim that starts from an distinct corner point on the vessel exterior and angles upwards and inwards.</p>
<h4 id="inc">Incurving rim</h4>
<p>A rim with a convex profile, where the lip curves inward toward the vessel's centre. The transition from body to rim is gradual, with a curve rather than a sharp corner.</p>
<h3 id="rim">Rim profile</h3>
<p>The rim profile describes how the inner and outer walls meet to form the lip.</p>
<h4 id="para">Parallel rim</h4>
<p>In parrallel rims the outer and inner walls stay the same distance apart.</p>
<h4 id="abrn">Abrupt narrow rim</h4>
<p>In abrupt narrow rims, the outer and inner walls suddenly start to converge close to the lip.
</p>
<h4 id="abrw">Abrupt wide rim</h4>
<p>In abrupt wide rims, close to the lip, the outer and inner walls suddenly start to diverge.</p>
<h4 id="gradi">Gradually narrow rim</h4>
<p>In gradually narrow rims, the outer and inner walls gradually start to converge close to the lip.</p>
<h4 id="gradoe">Gradually thickened exterior rim</h4>
<p>In gradually thickened exterior rims, the outer wall gradually changes direction moving further from the inner wall.</p>
<h4 id="gradoi">Gradually thickened interior rim</h4>
<p>In gradually thickened interior rims, the inner wall gradually changes direction moving further from the outer wall.</p>
<h4 id="roundb">Rounded both sides rim</h4>
<p>Rounded both sides rims are a variant of the wide abrupt rims where the rims have rounded lips on both the interior and exterior. </p>
<h4 id="roundi">Rounded thickened interior rim</h4>
<p>Rounded thickened interior rims are a variant of the wide abrupt rims where the rims have a rounded lip on the interior.</p>
<h4 id="roundo">Rounded thickened exterior rim</h4>
<p>Rounded thickened exterior rims are a variant of the wide abrupt rims where the rims have a rounded lip on the exterior.</p>

<h2 id="decp">Decoration position</h2>
<h3 id="declip">Decorated lip</h3>
<p>Vessel lips can be plain or decorated, with techniques such as notching, incision, punctation and dentate stamping.</p>
<h3 id="decrim">Decorated rim</h3>
<p>Vessel <a href="#rim">rims</a> can be left plain or decorated with the various <a href="#dect">decoration types</a>. For unrestricted vessels, this refers to those with decorations near the lip of the vessel.</p>
<h3 id="intdecrim">Internal decorated rim</h3>
<p>The inside of vessel <a href="#rim">rims</a> can be decorated with incisions, punctations or exposed coils.</p>
<h3 id="decnec">Decorated neck or collar</h3>
<p>Vessel <a href="#neck">necks</a> or <a href="#coll">collars</a> can be decorated with one or more of the various <a href="#dect">decoration types</a>.</p>
<h3 id="decsho">Decorated shoulder</h3>
<p>Vessel <a href="#sho">shoulders</a> can be decorated with one or more of the various <a href="#dect">decoration types</a>.</p>
<h3 id="decbody">Decorated body</h3>
<p>In some vessels the whole vessel, including the shoulder, neck and rim are decorated with one or more of the various <a href="#dect">decoration types</a>.</p>

<h2 id="dect">Decoration type</h2>
<h3 id="plain">Plain</h3>
<p>Vessels can be left plain with no decoration, except for colourants such as redslip, ie no exposed coil, clay removal and addition.</p>
<h3 id="expo">Exposed coils</h3>
<p>Exposed coil decorated vessels are <a href="#coil">coil built</a> but instead of the walls being smoothed all over, some areas, sometimes the whole vessel interior are left revealing the coils. Sometimes the coils are left exposed in patterns such as triangles.</p>
<h4 id="fing">Finger marks</h4>
<p>Several decorations can be made with human fingers, including fingernail impressions, scratching, pinching, gorging and dragging.</p>
<h3 id="rem">Clay removal</h3>
<h4 id="impr">Impressing</h4>
<p>Impressing is when a tool is pushed into the clay, displacing the clay, to leave an indentation. The displaced clay is not all removed but compresses and slightly bulges around the impressed area.</p>
<h5 id="punct">Punctation (simple impressing)</h5>
<p>Punctation marks are indentations in the clay from a shell, bamboo, bone or wooden tool. They can be several different shapes including, circular, triangular and rectangular. </p>
<h5 id="imprcom">Comb impressing</h5>
<p>Comb impressions are made with a multi-pronged tool that is pressed into the clay. </p>
<h5 id="dent">Dentate</h5>
<p>Dentate decoration consists of complex-patterned stamp impressions. The impressions are made from 
  multi-toothed tools, that result in multiple small (mm wide) indentations in straight or curved lines, with multiple lines combined to form larger complex patterns.  </p>
 <figure><img src="{% static "vessels/images/dentate.jpg" %}" alt="Three dentate sherds with many intricate small toothed impressions." ></figure>
<figcaption> Three Lapita sherds from Anir and Ambitle (Bismarcks) with dentate decoration.</figcaption> 

<h5 id="padi">Paddle impressing</h5>
<p>Paddle impressions are made from a paddle with carved patterns that is pressed against the vessel, leaving patterned imprints. </p>
<h5 id="cord">Cord impressing</h5>
<p>Cord impressions are made with a cord or rope that is pressed into the clay. The cord is usually wrapped around a paddle that is pressed against the vessel. Also called cord-marked.</p>
<h4 id="incis">Incising</h4>
<p>Incising is when fine lines are made in the clay. The clay is displaced with a pointed tool that is pushed or pulled along the vessel surface.
  Incisions can be simple or comb incisions.</p>
<h5 id="incsin">Simple incising</h5>
<p>Simple incising is when a tool with a single point, is used to make fine lines in the clay. Incisions can be straight or wavy lines and can vary in length.</p>
<h5 id="inccom">Comb incising</h5>
<p>Comb incising is when a multi-pronged tool is used to make simiulatenous incisions in straight or wavy lines. These can vary in length from
  short patterns to lines that circumscribe the vessel.</p>
<h4 id="gro">Grooving</h4>
<p>Grooving is when the clay is removed in continuous channels, with a wider, rounder pointed tool, than fine incison. The edge of the 
  groove is clean and sharp and the strokes end abruptly.</p> 
<h4 id="sco">Scouring</h4>
<p>Scouring is when the vessel is given multiple striations, resulting in a textured surface.</p> 
<h4 id="carv">Carving</h4>
<p>Carving and <mark id="gour">gouging</a> are where the clay is removed (in curls) from the vessel wall for decoration. Larger amounts of clay are removed than incision, but the wall is not perforated. 
  The patterns can be formed by the area removed, or the area left unremoved.</p>
<h4 id="perf">Perforating</h4>
<p>Perforating is where bits of are completely removed from the vessel wall. This can be for decoration or for functional reasons such as
  to make a pot for smoking fish.</p>
<h3 id="addi">Clay addition</h3>
<h4 id="appl">Applique</h4>
<p>Clay decoration that is applied to vessel surface. The applied elements include: smaller additions such as nubbins and lugs; longer bands; and larger sculptural elements.</p>
<h5 id="lug">Nubbins and lugs</h5>
<p>Lugs are pieces of clay that have been added to the vessel wall. They sometimes act as handles and have holes for string for hanging. 
  Nubbins are smaller clay pieces, generally round or oval shaped that have been applied to the vessel. While often formed through addition, lugs and nubbins can also be created from pulling or pinching the forms out from the vessel. </p>
<h5 id="band">Bands</h5>
<p>Strips or coils of clay were applied to (or sometimes pinched out from) the vessel exterior as decoration. 
  Sometimes the top <mark id="remc">remnanent coil</mark> was brought down from the rim and used. 
  For some vessels the bands were further decorated with notching or incising. </p>
<h4 id="sculp">Sculpting</h4>
<p>Sculpting refers to the addition of clay element representations of zoomorphic or anthromorphic forms. Also called modelling.</p>
<h3 id="liq">Liquid colourants</h3>
<p>Coloured liquids could be added to the plain or decorated vessels. Slips were added before firing, while glazing and painting was done after firing.</p>
<h4 id="red">Red slip</h4>
<p>Slip is a more dilute clay water mixture, added to the vessel before firing, with red slip having a brighter red colour than most clays.
   Sometimes red slip vessel decoration included the addition of white lime to highlight incised or impressed decorations. 
  Red slip is the most common slip colour in the Pacific, but a yellowish-tan slip was used in Buin.</p>
<h4 id="glaze">Glazing</h4>
<p>Glazing of pots with plant resins is done after firing, sometimes when the vessel is still hot from the firing. It results in a glossy alteration of the fired vessel clay colour rather than a different colour.</p>
   <h4 id="paint">Painting</h4>
<p>Painting allowed vessels to be coloured with liquid paints or dyes of white, brown, black, grey, yellow or red. 
  Sometimes painting was not done by the original makers, but by the users (such as in the highlands of Papua New Guinea) and in this vocabulary it refers to when the potting community utilised it.</p>

<h2 id="fun">Vessel function</h2>
<h3 id="cook">Cooking</h3>
<p>Cooking vessels were used to produce meals by heating.</p>
<h4 id="boil">Cooking - boiling</h4>
<p>Cooking meals by boiling or stewing involved the addition of liquids, such as water. </p>
<h4 id="bake">Cooking - baking</h4>

 <h2 id="potter">Potter attributes</h2>
 <h3 id="lang">Language</h3>
 <p>The more recent vessel types are generally identified by the language of their potters, and in many cases the site location represents several villages, and is taken from the glottolog 'location' for that language. The language codes are <a href="https://iso639-3.sil.org">iso639-3</a>.
</p>

 <h3 id="gen">Gender</h3>
 <p>In Pacific communities, at the time of European contact, creating pottery was often only performed by <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8441">men</a> or <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q467">women</a>. Sometimes members of the opposite sex could not even be present while vessels were being made. 
However, often the various steps of pottery creation, such as: clay collection; vessel formation; and vessel decoration had different restrictions. The database records the gender of the vessel formers and the decorators, where known from ethnographic accounts.</p>
